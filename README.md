 ## project background

 Within the educational sector, school cafeterias face significant challenges in maintaining operational efficiency while minimizing food waste. Traditional methods of manual or semi-manual dish counting, crucial for assessing meal portions and planning food preparation, often result in inaccuracies and inefficiencies. To overcome these challenges, this project introduces an innovative automated system for counting washed dishes in the schoolâ€™s dining hall.
The system employs a combination of IR proximity and distance sensors to accurately detect trays and differentiate between those carrying dishes or other objects. By automating the dish counting process, the system enhances operational efficiency, reduces food waste, and provides precise data for meal planning and inventory management. Despite encountering anomalies attributed to non-very reliable sensors and the dynamic kitchen environment, where the washing machine is placed, the results remain generally acceptable.
This project represents a collaborative effort between Linnaeus Uni- versity, Kalmar Municipality, and Uptilt Company, reflecting a shared commitment to sustainability through reduced food waste in educa- tional institutions.

  # Repo caontains
   the project is two prototypes that was tested to solve the issue with counting plate

   ##prototype
   ### harware used in first prototype:
   - lora heltec 32 v2.
   - 3 IR sensors.

   ### harware used in second prototype:
   - lora heltec 32 v2.
   - one IR sensor.
   - one pololu sensor (time of light sensor)


   ### softwere in both prototype:
   - VSCode and esp-IDf extension.
   - TTN ESP32 library: the lisence of the library is the libriray exapmles.
   - the first prototyp is C, while the second is in c/c++.
