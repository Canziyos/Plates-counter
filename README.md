 ## project background

 Within the educational sector, school cafeterias face significant challenges in maintaining operational efficiency while minimizing food waste. Traditional methods of manual or semi-manual dish count- ing, crucial for assessing meal portions and planning food prepara- tion, often result in inaccuracies and inefficiencies. To overcome these challenges, this project introduces an innovative automated system for counting washed dishes in the schoolâ€™s dining hall.
The system employs a combination of IR proximity and distance sensors to accurately detect trays and differentiate between those carry- ing dishes or other objects. By automating the dish counting process, the system enhances operational efficiency, reduces food waste, and provides precise data for meal planning and inventory management. Despite encountering anomalies attributed to non-very reliable sensors and the dynamic kitchen environment, where the washing machine is placed, the results remain generally acceptable.
This project represents a collaborative effort between Linnaeus Uni- versity, Kalmar Municipality, and Uptilt Company, reflecting a shared commitment to sustainability through reduced food waste in educa- tional institutions.

  # plan for the next week:

   - make changes in project proposal
   - Starting with the software development phase of the project (Starting with implementation).
   - prototype planing and development.
   - planing for another study visit.
   - review Latex and project report template.
